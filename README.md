I have completed the associate Profit Splitter and the Tiered profit splitter 


The associate profit splitter you can see is first declaring who the people we are paying are and then we are taking the amount that we get and splitting it by 3 and then sending it off to each employee evenly. 
Then we are taking any remainders and then again doing it again 
Once the code is ready it is compiled and deployed and then you have to enter the address of each employee (their public address from their wallet) and then deploy the contract which gets in touch with meta mask which supplies the coin. 

The Tiered Profit splitter  works In a similar way only this time when we divide up the money its based on how much each person its entitled too employee_one 60% and so on so forth but this time the remainder amount was collected and also sent to emplotee_one as we understand employee_one is the CEO. Simlarly we compile deploy and provide all wallet address and use metamask to provide the funds 


instead of snapshots i have inlcluded the code itslef in the folder Solidity_folder
